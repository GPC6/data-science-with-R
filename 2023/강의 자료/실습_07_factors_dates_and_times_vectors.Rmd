```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, error=TRUE)
```


# Prerequisite

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(forcats)   # Package for dealing with factors
library(lubridate) # Package for dealing with dates and times
```


# Factors

Recall that __factor = categorical variables__. `forcats` package contains helpers for manipulating factors.

* reordering factor levels
    * moving specified levels to front
    * ordering by first appearance
    * reversing
    * randomly shuffling
* modifying factor levels
    * collapsing rare levels into other
    * 'anonymising'
    * manually 'recoding'

## Reordering levels

Two functions covered in class:

* `fct_relevel`: Reordering by hand.
* `fct_reorder`: Reordering by sorting along another variable.

```{r}
gss_cat$relig %>% levels()
```

```{r}
gss_cat$relig %>%
  fct_reorder(gss_cat$tvhours, function(x) mean(x, na.rm = TRUE), .desc = TRUE) %>%
  levels()
```

```{r}
gss_cat$relig %>%
  fct_relevel(c("Not applicable", "None")) %>%
  levels()
```

## Modifying levels

Three functions covered in class:

* `fct_recode`: Modifying by hand.
* `fct_collapse`: Collapse levels into manually defined groups.
* `fct_lump`: Lump together least (or most) common factor levels into `"other"`.

```{r}
gss_cat$partyid %>% table()
```

```{r}
gss_cat$partyid %>%
  fct_recode(
    "Republican, strong" = "Strong republican",
    "Republican, weak" = "Not str republican",
    "Independent, near rep" = "Ind,near rep",
    "Independent, near dem" = "Ind,near dem",
    "Democrat, weak" = "Not str democrat",
    "Democrat, strong" = "Strong democrat",
    "Other" = "Don't know",
    "Other" = "No answer",
    "Other" = "Other party") %>%
  fct_collapse(
    "Rep" = c("Republican, strong", "Republican, weak"),
    "Ind" = c("Independent", "Independent, near rep", "Independent, near dem"),
    "Dem" = c("Democrat, strong", "Democrat, weak")) %>%
  table
```

```{r}
gss_cat$relig %>% table
```

```{r}
gss_cat$relig %>% fct_lump(n = 10) %>% table
```

# Dates and Times

Almost every programming languages has three data types for denoting dates and/or times:

* __Date__ _e.g._, `2017-11-28`.
* __Time__ _e.g._, `00:01:25`.
* __Date-time__ _e.g._, `2017-11-28 00:01:25 KST`.

`lubridate` package ([cheatsheet](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/raw/master/lubridate.pdf)) contains functions to work with date-times and time-spans.

* fast and user friendly parsing of date-time data
* extraction and updating of components of a date-time
    * _e.g._ years, months, days, hours, minutes, and seconds
* algebraic manipulation on date-time and time-span objects.

## Create Date / Time / Date-time

* `make_datetime`, `make_date`.
* `as_datetime`, `as_date`.

### Parse From String

Recall that __Date / Time / Date-time != String__. Actually, the date-time is the number of seconds that have elapsed since 1970-01-01 00:00:00 UTC.

Nomenclature of string parsers in `lubridate` package:

* Date part. __y__: year, __m__: month, __d__: day.
* Time part. __h__: hour, __m__: minute, __s__: second.
* Optional separator between date and time: _ (underscore)
* Accepts a wide variety of input formats.

List of `lubridate` parsers

Remarks:

* Some combinations are not implemented; _e.g._ `mhs` and `ymd_ms`
* Each part accepts a wide variety of formats.

## Getting / Setting Components

There are various accessors including `year`, `month`, `mday`, `yday`, `wday`, and many others.

```{r}
x <- ymd_hms("2014년 11월 12일 06:00:00", tz = "Asia/Seoul")  # tz: Timezone; default is UTC.
date(x); day(x); hour(x)
```

```{r}
hour(x) <- 20; x
```

## Arithmetics

Three concepts:

* Periods
* Durations
* Intervals

![](ext/math_with_date-times.PNG)

```{r}
nor <- ymd_hms("2018-01-01 01:30:00", tz = "US/Eastern")  # Normal day
gap <- ymd_hms("2018-03-11 01:30:00", tz = "US/Eastern")  # Begin summertime
lap <- ymd_hms("2018-11-04 00:30:00", tz = "US/Eastern")  # End summertime

nor + minutes(90); gap + minutes(90); lap + minutes(90)
```

```{r}
nor + dminutes(90); gap + dminutes(90); lap + dminutes(90)
```

```{r}
interval(nor, nor + minutes(90)); interval(gap, gap + minutes(90)); interval(lap, lap + minutes(90))
```

# Vectors

## Integer vs Double

```{r}
typeof(1)
```

```{r}
typeof(1L)
```

```{r}
typeof(1.5L)
```

```{r}
as.integer(1.6)
```

## Finite precision

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floating-point_arithmetic

```{r}
(x <- sqrt(2) ^ 2)
```

```{r}
x - 2
```

```{r}
x - 2 == 0
```

```{r}
near(x - 2, 0)
```

## Special values

```{r}
c(-1, 0, 1) / 0
```

```{r}
max(c())
```

```{r}
min(c())
```

```{r}
(x <- c(1:10, NA, Inf))
```

```{r}
range(x, na.rm=TRUE)
```

```{r}
range(x, na.rm=TRUE, finite=TRUE)
```

## Vector containing multiple types

```{r}
typeof(c(TRUE, 2L))
```

```{r}
typeof(c(1L, 1.5))
```

```{r}
typeof(c(1.5, "a"))
```

## Recycling rules

```{r}
sample(10) + 100
```

```{r}
1:10 + 1:2
```

```{r}
tibble(x = 1:4, y = 1:2)
```

```{r}
tibble(x = 1:4, y = rep(1:2, 2))
```

```{r}
tibble(x = 1:4, y = rep(1:2, each = 2))
```

```{r}
tibble(x=1:4, y=1)
```
